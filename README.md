# Rimbound - Novakin Xenotype
This mod added the Novakin xenotype that is included within a series called "Rimbound".

Easily one of the most enigmatic known races, the Novakin are sapient plasma-shelled "gas-bags" in a humanoid shape, with metallic "brands" where their faces would be.
A generally carefree and capricious people with notoriously short memories and attention spans, they live in the moment, wandering the stars in search of adventure or whatever, with little reflection on the past. 
So unconcerned are they with what happened before now, they have forgotten their own origins, having never bothered to catalog their history.
Thus where they came from and how they were formed may forever be a mystery.
